The "chess.py" file simulates a board as a 2d list. 0 represents an empty square, while other pieces are represented as classes that will be added onto the board on startup.

These classes contain several internal functions and variables specific to the piece.
  EX: Pawn needs a bool value to determine if it has moved or not.

The purpose of this function is to be able to read the contents of a board, and determine all the legal moves that can be made given a piece.
